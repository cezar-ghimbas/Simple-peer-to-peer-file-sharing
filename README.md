# simple-peer-to-peer-file-sharing

This is a simple application that allows clients to connect to each other (forming a peer-to-peer network), search for files and download them. It's based on the Gnutella v0.4 peer-to-peer protocol https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse522/05au/gnutella_protocol_0.4.pdf.
